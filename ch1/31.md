[1.31](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.31): 
a.  Write an analogous procedure (to sum) called product
that returns the product of the values of a function at points over a given range.
Show how to define factorial in terms of product.
Also use product to compute approximations to pi
