[1.42](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.42):
Let f and g be two one-argument functions. The composition f after g is defined
to be the function x->f(g(x)). Define a procedure `compose` that implements composition. 
For example, if `inc` is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument,

```
((compose square inc) 6)
>> 49
```

--

```scheme
(define (compose g f)
    (lambda (x)
        (g (f x))))
```

```
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (inc x) (+ x 1))
((compose square inc) 6)
>> 49
```
