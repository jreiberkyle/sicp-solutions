[1.37](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.37):  a. An infinite continued fraction is an expression of the form

`f = N1 / (D1 + N2 / (D2 + (N3 / (D3 + ... ))))`

As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion with the Ni and the Di all equal to 1
produces 1/phi, where phi is the golden ratio (described in section
[1.2.2](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.2)).
One way to approximate an infinite continued
fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number of terms. Such a truncation -- a so-called k-term
finite continued fraction -- has the form

`f = N1 / (D1 + N2 / (D2 + .... Nk / Dk ))`

Suppose that n and d are procedures of one argument (the term index i) that return the Ni and Di of the terms of
the continued fraction. Define a procedure cont-frac such that evaluating `(cont-frac n d k)` computes the value
of the k-term finite continued fraction. Check your procedure by approximating 1/phi using

```
(cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           k)
```
for successive values of k.

How large must you make k in order to get an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places? phi ~= 1.6810

```scheme
(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (cont-frac-iter i)
    (newline)
    (display i)  
    (if (> i k)
        0
        (/ (n i) (+ (d i) (cont-frac-iter (+ i 1))))
    ))
  (cont-frac-iter 0)
)


(/ 1 (cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
           12)
)
```

b. If your cont-frac procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process.
If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.

(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (cont-frac-iter i accum)
    (newline)
    (display accum)
    (if (< i 0)
        accum
        (cont-frac-iter (- i 1) (/ (n i) (+ (d i) accum)))
    ))
  (cont-frac-iter k 0)
)

(/ 1 (cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
           (lambda (i) 1.0)
