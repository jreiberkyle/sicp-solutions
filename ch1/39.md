[1.39](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.39): 
A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician
J.H. Lambert:
tan x = x / (1 - x^2/(3 - x^2/(5 - ...)))
where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an approximation to the tangent function
based on Lambert's formula. K specifies the number of terms to compute, as in exercise 1.37.

```scheme
(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (cont-frac-iter i accum)
    (newline)
    (display accum)
    (if (< i 0)
        accum
        (cont-frac-iter (- i 1) (/ (n i) (+ (d i) accum)))
    ))
  (cont-frac-iter k 0)
)

(define (tan-cf x k)
    (cont-frac (lambda (i) (if (= i 0) x (- 0 (* x x))))
            (lambda (i) (+ 1 (* 2 (+ 1 i))))
            k)
)
```
