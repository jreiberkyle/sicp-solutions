[1.33](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.33): 
You can obtain an even more general version of accumulate (exercise 1.32) by introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is, combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a specified condition. The resulting filtered-accumulate abstraction takes the same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one argument that specifies the filter. Write filtered-accumulate as a procedure.

```scheme
(define (filtered-accumulate combiner null-value term a next b filter)
    (define (iter result a b)
        (cond ((> a b) result)
              ((filter a) (iter (combiner result (term a)) (next a) b))
              (else (iter result (next a) b))
        )
    )
    (iter null-value a b)
)
(define (test-filtered-accumulate)
    (define (even? n) (= (remainder n 2) 0))
    (define (remainder x y) (- x (* (floor (/ x y)) y)))
    (define (incr a) (+ a 1))
    (define (iden a) a)
    (= 12 (filtered-accumulate + 0 iden 0 incr 6 even?))
)
```

Show how to express the following using filtered-accumulate:
a. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a to b (assuming that you have a prime? predicate already written)

--
```scheme
(define (sum-of-squares-of-primes a b)
    (define (incr a) (+ a 1))
    (define (square a) (* a a))
    (filtered-accumulate + 0 square a incr b prime?)
)
```

--
b. the product of all the positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i < n such that `GCD(i,n) = 1`).

--
```scheme
(define (gcd a b)
    (define (remainder x y) (- x (* (floor (/ x y)) y)))
    (if (= b 0)
        a
        (gcd b (remainder a b)))
)

(define (product-of-relative-primes n)
    (define (incr a) (+ a 1))
    (define (iden a) a)
    (define (rel-prime? a) (= (gcd a n) 1))
    (filtered-accumulate * 1 iden 1 incr n rel-prime?)
)
```
