[1.41](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.41):
Define a procedure `double` that takes a procedure of one argument as argument and
returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For example, if `inc`
is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then `(double inc)` should be a procedure
that adds 2.

What value is returned by `(((double (double double)) inc) 5)` ?

(define (double proc)
    (lambda (x)
        (proc (proc x))))
