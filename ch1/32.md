[1.32](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.32): 
Show that product and sum are special cases of a general accumulate function
`(accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)`

--

```scheme
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
    (define (iter result a b)
        (if (> a b)
            result
            (iter (combiner result (term a)) (next a) b)
        )
    )
    (iter null-value a b)
)
(define (product term a next b)
    (accumulate * 1 term a next b)
)
(define (sum term a next b)
    (accumulate + 0 term a next b)
)
```
