[1.3](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_thm_1.3): Define a procedure that takes
three numbers as args and returns the sum of squares of the two larger numbers
--
```scheme
(define (sum-of-squares a b)
    (+ (* a a) (* b b))
)

(define (sum-of-squares-of-largest-two a b c)
    (cond ((and (>= a c) (>= b c)) (sum-of-squares a b))
          ((and (>= a b) (>= c b)) (sum-of-squares a c))
          (else (sum-of-squares b c))
    )
)
