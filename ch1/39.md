[1.39](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_thm_1.39): 
A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 1770 by the German mathematician
J.H. Lambert:
tan x = x / (1 - x^2/(3 - x^2/(5 - ...)))
where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an approximation to the tangent function
based on Lambert's formula. K specifies the number of terms to compute, as in exercise 1.37.
