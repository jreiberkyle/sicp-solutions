1.35 Show that the golden ratio (`(phi = 1 + sqrt(5))/2`, satisfies `phi^2 = phi + 1`) is a fixed point of the transformation `x -> 1 + 1/x`, 
and use this fact to compute the golden ratio by means of the fixed-point procedure.

```scheme
(define tolerance 0.00001)
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(define phi
  (fixed-point (lambda (y) (+ 1 (/ 1 y)))
               1.0))
```
